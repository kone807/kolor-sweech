# Description

A JavaFX application for the game - Color Switch. The objective of the game is to collect
as many stars as possible by manoeuvring the obstacles. If you hit any obstacle, you can continue
with your earned stars or the game ends and you have to start from the beginning. This is a high
score game. We have developed only the endless (infinity) game mode of the classic
gameplay. Some of the rules of the game: 

1) The player has to use a single input to keep the ball afloat as well as move upward. A
constant amount of distance is travelled each time the input is given.

2) The ball will fall if no input is given, as if it is moving against gravity.

3) The player has to collect the “Stars” placed along the gameplay. This will be counted
towards the score.

4) Color switches are used to change the ball color and make the game interesting.

5) Different kinds of obstacles are created to increase difficulty

7) The Stars collected can be used to resurrect the ball in case the ball hits an obstacle.

8) The option to save game is also provided

9) A player can save as well as load any saved game with multiple save/load games allowed

10) The theme of an astronaut is added to make the game interesting.
